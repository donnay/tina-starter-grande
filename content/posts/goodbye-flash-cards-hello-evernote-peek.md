Well it was bound to happen, and it has. A very inventive company that makes the iOS app Evernote has come up with a new one and itâ€™s a zinger!

It is called Evernote Peek, and it replaces the old flash cards using an iPad 2 and the new iPad Smart cover. Take a look at this video to see how it works. [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqVjruCt6yg&amp;feature=player\_embedded](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqVjruCt6yg&feature=player_embedded "Evernote Peek")

You can even include pictures in the answer and score which one you got right or wrong to replay the wrong ones. This is the type of ingenuity I am expecting with iDevices and the learning/education market. We are starting to replace textbooks with eBooks, and we learn astronomy with Star Walker and now we replace old flash cards with Evernote Peek.

I love using technology to learn!
