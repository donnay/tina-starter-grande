I had the pleasure recently to explore the world of 3d Virtual spaces. A client was looking for a way to use one of these environments to add some collaboration to their online learning experience.

I loved being able to explore this area and had a blast! There are only about 3 or 4 companies in the space, Second Life being the one most known, but when snooping around, I felt it just didn’t quite make it for corporations without a lot of work.

Of the three contenders, I found **Avaya Live** to be the most complete.

Wow did this software and it’s capabilities knock my socks off. I love lots about it and will add more in the next post.

Many learners complain about the lack of connection to real people or subject matter experts as they complete learning.

This kind of 3d virtual space tool will help immensely with that. Stay tuned for an in depth look at Avaya Live 3d Virtual environment
