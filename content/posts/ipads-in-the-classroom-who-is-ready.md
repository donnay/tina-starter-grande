I am reading a lot lately about using iPads in the classroom. A particularly good read is Mashables article, <http://mashable.com/2011/05/16/tablets-education/> about classroom readiness for the iPad.

But what I want to talk about isn’t the iPad or the classroom, it’s the people involved. Yes students of this generation are familiar with smartphones and touch technology, but what about their teachers. Many that I know of, are not comfortable with technology or have limited abilities to use it and I think this is one of the bottlenecks/challenges we have today. Brining an older generation into this one so students can expand their learning in amazing ways.

I am a big believer in using technology and tablets in the classroom, I just think we need to help those not as familiar to better learn and understand, most teachers want the best for their studetns, we just need to give them more tools, and pay for them too!

Just my thoughts!
