There are three types of learners, management, merchandising and general retail employee. It is one course used by all, when the learner selects a role, the course will only provide them with the information they require. This module also has a menu, so employees can return to zero in on a specific item they wish to review. [Link](http://www.netlearningspace.com/Online/BOBJ/index.html "Link")
