[![](/content/uploads/2010/06/IMGP1459-150x150.jpg "IMGP1459")](/content/uploads/2010/06/IMGP1459.jpg)Many years ago I attended or facilitated many training sessions, partularly computer software training that were one or more days long. We conducted things this way because it was felt important for people to get as much information as possible for the best time they had available and buck.

Many instances of what I call the 3 o’clock freeze or brain overload happened when learners would have this glazed look on their faces and pretty much stop learning, answering questions, etc. Of course, sitting in a classroom for 6 to 7 hours in a day seemed like a good idea but now I know better.

Today, employees and learners just don’t have the time in their day to spend all of it in class, or just don’t want to, so I started creating training sessions of 2 hours.

The outcome surprised me at first, it seemed like they weren’t getting much information or skills but what I found was that 2 hours was just about right.

The learners acquire some new skills, they remember all that is taught, for the most part, they go back to their desk and apply what was learnt almost immediately, meaning they used the new skills and so would remember them more often.

When using this type of learning paradigm, create a series of sessions the learner needs to commit to, and then once the first session is complete, it is rare that they won’t be back for more. What happened was they could use the skills they learned and were interested in advancing their knowledge more. They were excited to come back to class and learn more skills to make their job and duties easier or efficient.

So next time you are given the opportunity to create software learning, think about how to provide it as much as the content. If the content is really relevant to the learner and they learn some skills each session, they will return with excitement and interest instead of feeling like they must attend.
