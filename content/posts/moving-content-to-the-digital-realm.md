eBooks are fast becoming the norm for many books, documents and other materials / content being moved to the web and to digital eReaders and tablets like the iPad.

As a creator of content, it is very handy for me to have that content on a device that allows me to hold hundreds, if not thousands of my books/documents at a time, relieiving me from carrying around paper-based versions. Now that they have become digital, I can then expand the features I want to use like interactive
