I was recently introduced to Worldreader, a innovative nonprofit program that helps get ereaders and ebooks and newspapers in the hands of children in 3rd world / developing countries.

I have always supported the One Computer Per Child program but that seems to be waning in its ability to expand and is dependant on governments to support it. This is about low cost ereaders like the Kindle getting into the hands of children.

Cory Doctorow has an awesome piece including a video on his site at <http://craphound.com/?p=3420>

Being a technology educator and using technology in education is important and ensuring children who barely get to go to school can read and learn about our world through books, of all kinds, is a wondrous thing.

Support this if you can or if you know of an author with a good book, ask if they will donate it in ebook form to this program.
