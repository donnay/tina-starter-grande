[![](/content/uploads/2010/12/Technologysmall.jpg "Technologysmall")](/content/uploads/2010/12/Technologysmall.jpg)A couple of bloggers I follow have benn having a discussion about what technology should be to learners. @frankcrawford and @fraserspeirs have compiled a list as follows:

**As a learner, technology should be:**  
1.Everywhere, ready to use.  
2.Easy to use.  
3.Desirable to use.  
4.Challenging my skills.  
5.Sharable  
6.Collaborative  
7.It should play to my passions  
8.Used in useful contexts (from the learner’s perspective)  
9.Authentic

Personally, I agree with all this list but would place the importance to items differently.

So what do you think of this list and do you agree?
