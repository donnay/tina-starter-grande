I just read an article/paper published by UBC on the use of interactive teaching methods in a large undergrad physics class. It is here..

[http://www.publicaffairs.ubc.ca/2011/05/12/interactive-teaching-methods-double-learning-engagement-in-large-undergraduate-physics-class/](http://www.publicaffairs.ubc.ca/2011/05/12/interactive-teaching-methods-double-learning-engagement-in-large-undergraduate-physics-class/ "UBC Interactive Teaching Report")

I completely support their observations but also have to say DUH!

Those of us in Corporate training and particularly conducting Leadership and Management Development training have been using interactive teaching methods as part of our learning process for a long time and it is successful.

I think what this comes down to is particpation. Many groups of students such as large lecture environments is not great spaces for participation, it is a one to many scenario. Intereactive teaching demands more from teachers and the students and will also help them build community by working together.

This article is interesting and reaffirms that learning can be enhanced with activities that re-inforce the learning.
