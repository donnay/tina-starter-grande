I have had the pleasure of working in a 3D virtual space as part of a development program I created.

As mentioned in a previous [post](http://www.netlearningspace.com/bksi_new/?p=427), 3D Virtual environments can be useful for certain training and development programs. Here is a use case for creating this kind of space…

**Challenge:**

You want to develop a training program that utilizes both eLearning and classroom content, usually called a “Blended Learning” approach. The problem is, your learners are geographically dispersed. This makes it difficult and costly to have everyone meet to complete the in classroom component of the training.

You have discovered the cost of video conferencing systems and it is high, too high for your budget.

**Solution:**

This is where a 3D virtual space comes in. The learner will complete the eLearning component and then, at a designated date and time, join all the other learners in the virtual space, from their desk on their computers. Each learner is a person/avatar in the space and can interact similar to being in the same room.

They can:

- talk to individuals (spatial audio means if you are close by, you can hear someone, if you are far away, you can’t)
- a facilitator can talk them through learning, instructions or lecture
- learners can be directed into break out rooms, where only the people in the room can here and speak to each other
- learners can view and share websites, online learning components, documents, etc
- the space can also be used for meetings

The thing that impresses me with this option is the ability to simply blend and use one environment for classroom and online learning needs, regardless of where your learners are on the planet.

If you are interested in this kind of learning tool, here is the company I have used with success, Avaya Live Engage and here is a short video of what it does.. [Avaya Live demo](https://youtu.be/Yhiv43A5hmQ).

Many companies or Learning Specialists may not think this is a viable option but it is and at a cost that most organizations can manage.
