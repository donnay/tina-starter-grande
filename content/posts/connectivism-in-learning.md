[![](/content/uploads/2010/06/cropped-BurrardBridge-150x150.jpg "cropped-BurrardBridge.jpg")](/content/uploads/2010/06/cropped-BurrardBridge.jpg) This article came from the Huffington Post’s Stephen Downes, who is becoming very knowledgable about connectivism.

<span style="color: #008000;">**<span style="text-decoration: underline;">W</span>**</span>[<span style="color: #008000;">**hat is connectivism**</span>](http://halfanhour.blogspot.com/2007/02/what-connectivism-is.html)<span style="color: #008000;">**<span style="text-decoration: underline;">?</span>**</span> <span style="color: #008000;">At its heart, connectivism is the thesis that knowledge is distributed across a network of connections, and therefore that learning consists of the ability to construct and traverse those networks. Knowledge, therefore, is not *acquired*, as though it were a thing. It is not *transmitted*, as though it were some type of communication. </span>

<span style="color: #008000;">What we learn, what we know — these are literally the connections we form between neurons as a result of experience. The brain is composed of </span>[<span style="color: #008000;">100 billion neurons</span>](http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=100-trillion-connections)<span style="color: #008000;">, and these form some 100 trillion connections and it is these connections that constitute everything we know, everything we believe, everything we imagine. </span>

<span style="color: #008000;">And while it is convenient to *talk* as though knowledge and beliefs are composed of sentences and concepts that we somehow acquire and store, it is *more accurate* — and pedagogically more useful — to treat learning as the formation of connections</span>.

Hmm an interesting hypothesis, and a new way of looking at how we learn and how we teach learners. It seems to comes back to the old saying ; “it’s not what we know but who we know”.

Every new connection we make , be it a person, an idea or whatever, we are constantly learning and this is where I find this concept so interesting. Maybe we should spend more time encouraging learners to create more connections so they will be able to learn more. Another question is how can this be incorporated into a corporate or educational institution or is that what Social Media and Networks are already doing.

Just think of all the pictures of places and cities you have seen from your friends on Facebook. Have you learnt anything from them and the connection to that person? I think so.

Interesting? Yes / No?
