If you are interested in lots of free learning for you and your organization, you should know of it. It’s Apple’s iTunes U.

iTunes U is a gold mine of **FREE** online learning and a knowledge base every organization should be tapping. You can find eveything from MBA Business programs to How to Program for the iPhone and iPad.

There are medical, philosophical, business, technology, math, virtually any subject listed.

The number of educational institutitons that offer free learning via iTunes grows [![](http://www.netlearningspace.com/bksi_new/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/screen-capture-1.jpg "screen-capture-1")](http://www.netlearningspace.com/bksi_new/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/screen-capture-1.jpg)every day and you should be using it. Human Resource departments with tight budgets can use iTunes to expand their knowledge offering to employees. So check it out, notice the list of organizations in this image, it is impressive.

I have already completed a number of courses through it, it great and it’s FREE! What are you waiting for?
