Fraser has moved the school to a point where every student and teacher now have an iPad. Here is a quote from his blog..  
*<span style="color: #0000ff;">“I feel that teachers aren’t looking for “new software that I can run on this computing device”, rather that they’re asking “can I make this iPad into something else useful for my teaching?. </span>*

*<span style="color: #0000ff;">It’s worth pausing for a moment to fully realise what a sea-change this is in educational technology”.</span>*

<span style="color: #000000;">It is inspiring and informative to read the experience he and the school are going through and I encourage every teacher that reads this blog to check him out. [Fraser Speirs Ipad Project](http://speirs.org/blog/tag/theipadproject "Faser Speirs iPad Project")</span>

<span style="color: #000000;">I am inspired and happy to see that one of the decisions they made was not to “pigeon hole” the iPad as a text book replacement or for essays, they just handed them out and watched what staff and students would do with them. A brilliant way to allow innovation and creativity to abound.</span>

<span style="color: #000000;">I will continue to watch and read his experiences and will report new findings along the way.</span>

<span style="color: #000000;">Tell me where this could lead your school or future? The Apple iPad and the new range of Tablets due to appear will create changes and innovation in the way we learn. Become a part of it, not a victim of the change.</span>
